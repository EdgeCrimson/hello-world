Following the tutorial to get used to GitHub.

My name is Travis Asher. My current position is Assistant Research in Geographic Information Science (GIS) at the Department of Geography for the School of Liberal Arts at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). I graduated from IUPUI's School of Science in the spring of 2015 with a Bachelors of Science in Applied Mathematics, and I am currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Geographic Information Science in the IUPUI School of Liberal Arts. I am particularly interested in conveying mathematical concepts to University-level students, and I worked at the IUPUI Mathematics Assistance Center as a leading Calculus tutor from Spring 2011 to Summer 2015.
